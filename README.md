# Combining Machine Learning Bias Mitigation Approaches to Satisfy Multiple Fairness Constraints

This repository contains supplementary materials related to the paper titled "Combining Machine Learning Bias Mitigation Approaches to Satisfy Multiple Fairness Constraints" submitted to the AIES 2024 conference. The paper addresses the challenge of mitigating bias in machine learning algorithms in multiple fairness metrics. The proposed approach combines existing bias mitigation approaches targeting different fairness metrics to mitigate bias in multiple fairness metrics at the same time.

## Paper Abstract

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can suffer from biases, which may result in less favourable or unjust treatment across different demographic groups (e.g. females or ethnic minorities). Addressing these biases is crucial for ensuring fairness, yet it becomes complex when we need to achieve a balance between different fairness metrics. In this study, we conduct extensive and systematic experiments to explore the effectiveness of combining existing bias mitigation approaches to address multiple fairness metrics. We evaluate 12 bias mitigation approaches. For some of these approaches we include different configurations, as they can target different fairness metrics, resulting in a total of 26 different approaches. We then systematically combine these approaches, aiming to target multiple fairness objectives, resulting in more than 350 unique combinations. Our findings reveal that these combinations can help to improve fairness and can facilitate the simultaneous achievement of multiple fairness metrics. These findings carry significant implications for domains where meeting multiple fairness criteria is crucial, considering that most ML bias mitigation approaches typically focus on a single fairness metric, which may not fully address the multi-faceted nature of fairness in real-world contexts.
